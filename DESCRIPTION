Description: The laundRy package performs many standard preprocessing techniques 
    for dataframes, before use in statistical analysis and machine learning. 
    The package functionality includes categorizing column types, handling 
    missing data and imputation, transforming/standardizing columns and 
    feature selection. The laundRy package aims to remove much of the 
    grunt work in the typical data science workflow, allowing the analyst 
    maximum time and energy to devote to modelling!
